# Sweet Nectar Valley
> By Wendy Li and Patrick Tumbucon

## Motivation and Background

One of our favorite games is Stardew Valley. One of the best elements of the game is that there is no urgency to finish things by a certain deadline. There are little to no punishments for your behavior in the game. Even though this is the case, it is still extremely fun to play and very relaxing. Stardew Valley is a 2.5D game set on a farm scene that you get to design the way you want. Recreating the game in VR would make basic gameplay elements even more fun. 

## Description

- Outside on your farm
- Inside your home

Players will be able to:
- Till land
